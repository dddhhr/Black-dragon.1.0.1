## 🌍 Update DNS Settings  

If you experience **slow internet** or **repository connection issues**, update your DNS settings to **Google Public DNS**.  

🔹 **Run this command:**  

```bash
echo "nameserver 8.8.8.8" | sudo tee /etc/resolv.conf > /dev/null
echo "nameserver 8.8.4.4" | sudo tee -a /etc/resolv.conf > /dev/null
```

✅ This will:

Set 8.8.8.8 as the primary DNS server.

Set 8.8.4.4 as the secondary DNS server.


📌 If the issue persists, try using Cloudflare’s DNS:
```bash

echo "nameserver 1.1.1.1" | sudo tee /etc/resolv.conf > /dev/null
echo "nameserver 1.0.0.1" | sudo tee -a /etc/resolv.conf > /dev/null

🔄 Update & Upgrade System

Ensure your system is fully updated to avoid compatibility issues.

🔹 Run this command:
```bash
sudo apt update -y && sudo apt upgrade -y
````
📌 What this does:
```bash
apt update → Updates package lists.
```
```bash
apt upgrade → Installs the latest versions of all packages.
```

⚠️ If you get an error about a locked package manager:
```bash
sudo rm /var/lib/dpkg/lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock-frontend
sudo dpkg --configure -a
```

---

📦 Install Essential Packages

Install important tools like Python’s package manager and Chromium browser.

🔹 Run these commands:
```bash
sudo apt install -y python3-pip
sudo apt install -y chromium
````
**📌 Why?**

python3-pip → Manages Python libraries.


chromium → A lightweight browser for web automation.
